                        Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780â€“1839), known as the "Lion of Punjab," was a legendary leader and founder of the Sikh Empire in North India. Born in Gujranwala (now in Pakistan), he rose to prominence by uniting the fragmented Sikh misls (confederacies) into a powerful kingdom. His rule, from 1801 until his death, marked a golden era of prosperity, justice, and cultural renaissance in Punjab. Known for his exceptional military acumen, Ranjit Singh expanded his empire to include present-day Punjab, parts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Kashmir. He was also celebrated for his secular policies, as he appointed people of diverse faiths to high positions, fostering unity among Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims.
